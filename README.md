Theory on Git and GitHub

## 1. What is Version Control?
- ***Version control*** is a system that **tracks changes that we make to files over time**, allowing us to access previous versions of the files and collaborate with others on the same files without overwriting each other's work. 
- It is a system commonly used in software development to manage code changes, but can be applied to any type of file.

## 2. What is Git?
- ***Git*** is a **type of version control system that allows multiple people to work on the same code or project without accidentally overwriting each other's work**. 
- It keeps track of changes made to the code and allows you to view previous versions, or "commits", so you can easily undo changes if necessary. 
- Git also makes it easy to collaborate with others by allowing you to share your code with them and merge changes together.
